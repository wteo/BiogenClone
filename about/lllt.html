                        <h2>What is LLLT?</h2>
                        <p>Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT), also known as photobiomodulation or red light therapy, is a non-invasive treatment that uses specific wavelengths of light to stimulate cellular function. Unlike high-powered lasers used for surgery, LLLT uses low-power lasers or LEDs that don't generate heat or damage tissues.</p>
                        
                        <p>The therapy works by delivering red and near-infrared light (typically in the range of 630-850nm) to your skin and cells. These specific wavelengths can penetrate through the skin to various depths, interacting with light-sensitive components within your cells.</p>
                        
                        <h3>History of LLLT</h3>
                        <p>The therapeutic use of light has ancient roots, but modern LLLT began in the 1960s when Hungarian physician Endre Mester discovered that low-power laser treatment could stimulate hair growth and wound healing in mice. Since then, research into LLLT has expanded dramatically, with thousands of studies investigating its effects on various conditions and bodily systems.</p>

                <h2>The Science Behind LLLT</h2>
                <div class="science-cards">
                    <div class="science-card">
                        <h3>Cellular Mechanisms</h3>
                        <p>When red and near-infrared light penetrates your tissues, it's absorbed by photoreceptors in your cells, particularly in the mitochondria. The primary photoreceptor is cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), a key enzyme in the electron transport chain involved in cellular energy production.</p>
                        <p>This absorption triggers a series of cellular events that enhance energy production, modulate reactive oxygen species, and activate transcription factors that lead to changes in gene expression and protein synthesis.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="science-card">
                        <h3>Optimal Wavelengths</h3>
                        <p>Research has identified specific wavelengths that provide the most therapeutic benefits:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Red light (630-660nm):</strong> Primarily affects the skin, penetrating approximately 8-10mm</li>
                            <li><strong>Near-infrared light (810-850nm):</strong> Penetrates deeper (30-50mm) to affect muscles, bones, and deeper tissues</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These wavelengths fall within what's known as the "optical window" or "therapeutic window" where light can most effectively penetrate tissues.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="science-card">
                        <h3>Dosage Factors</h3>
                        <p>The effectiveness of LLLT depends on several parameters:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Wavelength:</strong> As discussed above, different wavelengths penetrate to different depths</li>
                            <li><strong>Power density:</strong> The power output per area (typically measured in mW/cm²)</li>
                            <li><strong>Energy density:</strong> The energy delivered per area (typically measured in J/cm²)</li>
                            <li><strong>Treatment duration:</strong> How long the light is applied</li>
                            <li><strong>Treatment frequency:</strong> How often therapy is administered</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Optimal dosing follows a biphasic dose response, meaning too little energy won't produce effects, while too much can inhibit benefits.</p>
